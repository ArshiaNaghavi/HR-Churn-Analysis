# 👥 Employee Attrition Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood (percentage) of employees who are likely to leave the company, based on various employee-specific parameters such as job role, salary, job satisfaction, and more. The problem is framed as a **classification problem** and solved using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company (Yes/No) based on features like:

- Job Role
- Salary
- Job Satisfaction
- Work Experience
- Department
- Overtime
- Age
- And other employee-related factors

## 🧠 Machine Learning Technique

- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm that is used to estimate the probability that an employee will leave the organization based on the given features.

## 📊 Features

- Preprocessing and encoding of categorical features (e.g., Job Role, Department)
- Feature selection and model training using logistic regression
- Evaluation of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Tuning of probability thresholds for better decision-making
